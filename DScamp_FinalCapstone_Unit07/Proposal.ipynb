    "# The Problem:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# The Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Metastases detection is currently performed manually by pathologists reviewing large expanses of \n",
    "    biological tissues and pathological images. An automatical framework, using a deep convolutional \n",
    "    neural network, shows promise of achieving higher tumor detection rate than human pathologists.\n",
    "    It can considerably increase the sensitivity, speed, and consistency of metastasis detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accomplish >70% tumor detection, and small false positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The dataset     \n",
    "\n",
    "    A dataset of gigapixel microscopy images sized 100*100 pixels is available to public. \n",
    "    The URL is https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/. Tens of thousands of image files, each sized \n",
    "    at ~1.8 GB, are available for both training set and testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The techniques:       \n",
    "\n",
    "    The technologies involved will be common python libraries, like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. \n",
    "    Additional libraries packages, i.e. tensorflow and keras, will be used extensively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Due to great demand for CPU and memory resources, google colab will be used to run training, testing \n",
    "    and  evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A special multi-layered deep convolutional neural network will be developed. The deep CNN will be \n",
    "    trained to capture different levels of abstraction. Several additional techniques will be applied \n",
    "    to increase precision, decrease false positive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Apply data augmentation. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            To increase the tumor patches, the input patch is rotated and left-right flipped to generate \n",
    "            8 orientations. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            To increase the tumor patches, the colors of input patch are perturbed to create more \n",
    "            varieties\n",
    "            \n",
    "            \n",
    "    2. Label data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "            Dispensed with the random forest classifier and feature engineering, data is labelled.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    3. Regularization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "            Randomly drop units from neural network to avoid overfitting\n",
    "    \n",
    "            kernel regularization as aplying penalties on layer parameters during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The biggest challenges are:    \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) get data, re-format data into a form which tensorflow can process\n",
    "                                        \n",
    "    2) build deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to get high accuracy results, to avoid overfitting.\n",
