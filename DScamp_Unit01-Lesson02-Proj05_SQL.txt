1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

WITH
    trips_simple
AS ( 
    SELECT duration, substring(start_date,1,10) as startDate, substring(end_date,1,10) as endDate,zip_code
        FROM trips 
)

SELECT tr.duration, tr.startDate, tr.endDate, tr.zip_code, we.date, we2.date, we.events, we2.events
FROM trips_simple tr
  JOIN
     weather we
  ON
     tr.zip_code = we.zip AND tr.startDate = we.date
  JOIN
     weather we2
  ON
     tr.zip_code = we2.zip AND tr.endDate = we2.date

WHERE we.events like '%Rain%' 
  AND we2.events like '%Rain%'
ORDER BY tr.duration desc;


Results:       trip_id, duration,
               1068614  62168
               1076000  28263
               1043263  10525





2. Which station is full most often?

WITH
    trips_simple
AS ( 
    SELECT trip_id, duration, substring(start_date,1,10) as startDate, substring(end_date,1,10) as endDate, 
               start_station, zip_code
        FROM trips 
)
 
SELECT startDate, start_station, COUNT(*) AS tot
FROM trips_simple
GROUP BY startDate, start_station
ORDER BY tot desc;


Results:	San Fransisco Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend)





3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

WITH
    trips_count
AS ( 
    SELECT start_station, COUNT(*) AS tot_trips
        FROM trips 
        GROUP BY start_station
)
 
SELECT tr.start_station, tr.tot_trips, st.dockcount
FROM trips_count tr
  JOIN
    stations st
  ON tr.start_station = st.name
ORDER BY st.dockcount desc;





4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
